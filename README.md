The Hilton Aspire credit card from American Express has a perk that gives holders $200 every six months towards any stay at one of the [Hilton Resort Credit Eligible Hotels](https://www.hilton.com/en/p/hilton-honors/resort-credit-eligible-hotels/).

Hilton does not have search filters to allow searching stays at these hotels, which makes it difficult to use.

When a similar issue arose for American Express Platinum Card holders looking to use their Fine Hotels + Resort credit, a useful website called [maxfhr.com](https://www.maxfhr.com/) stepped in to solve this problem, providing a tool for card holders to easily find inexpensive nights where their hotel credit would go a long ways.

This project similarly aims to provide a tool to easily find low-priced stays at Hilton Resort Credit Eligible Hotels.
